(AI) to play against the user. This project utilises basic Object-Oriented 
Programming,  Threading and Concurrency, a Graphical User Interface (GUI), Algorithms
and Artificial Intelligence.

## Aim of the Game

The aim of the game is to take Space-Man (the yellow ball with a jetpack), using the arrow keys on the computer keyboard, safely navigate through a maze full of energy pellets. The aim of Pacman: Space Edition is to collect all of energy pellets. It may seems easy, but it is not as simple as it seems – the task is made difficult because of four aliens – (pink one – Aaco, blue – Zod, red – Azals and orange – Vrezed). They are trying to catch Space-Man, and when one of them touches Space-Man, a life is lost. When all lives have been lost, the game ends.
The game has four game modes: classic mode; story mode; endless mode; and warp mode. The game also has an in game leaderboard to track who is the best Space-Man amongst your friends and family.
