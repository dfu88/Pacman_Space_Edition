## Objective
The overall goal of this project is to design an offline game as a Java application that takes 
input from users and responds accordingly, and to develop a computer artificial intelligence 
(AI) to play against the user. The purpose of this project is to learn basic Object-Oriented 
Programming,  Threading and  Concurrency, Graphical User Interface (GUI), Algorithm Development 
and Artificial Intelligence, Game Design and Iterative and Incremental Software Development. 

## Game Description
The aim is to create a game similar to Pacman, a game originally manufactured and sold by 
Namco in 1980. It was one of the most popular games everthat ushered ina new genre of video 
game when most arcade games were space shooters. The aim of the game is for the protagonist 
(i.e. Pacman, the yellow circle) to eat as many pellets (orange dotsand special cherries at times) 
as possible to get a high score, while avoiding the ghost enemies (red, blue, pink and orange blobs) 
and losing lives.
